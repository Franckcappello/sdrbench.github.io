Scientific Data Reduction Benchmarks
 
Comparison between scientific data reduction (including compression) techniques needs a rigorous and consistent methodology. This site provides scientific datasets, metrics, data reduction techniques and comparison results to assess and compare fairly the performance of scientific data reduction techniques.

Others: please submit your proposal of datasets to cappello (at) anl.gov. Requirements: datasets will be open to public access, dataset should be link to a simulation application or a scientific instrument, metadata should explain the origin of the dataset and how it has been produced (what simulation, what instrument, what settings). Upon review by the SDRBenchmark committee, the dataset will (or will not) be added to the SDR benchmark repository.
